    <textOnly>Hi {!Opportunity.First_Name__c},

It was a pleasure speaking with you, and I enjoyed hearing about your business.

While Collective wouldn&apos;t be able to service you, I would still like to provide you with some referrals. Below you&apos;ll find a couple of companies we&apos;ve heard some good things about:

Taxfyle.com - Formation and tax filing services - and you even get preferred pricing as a Collective referral!
Bench.co - Bookkeeping services designed for small businesses

Know someone in your network who would benefit from Collective&apos;s services? Take 30 seconds and join our referral program and share the word! If you refer someone and they become a member, you&apos;ll get $400, and they&apos;ll get one month at 50% off.  NO CAP ON PAYOUTS!

Best,
{!User.Name}</textOnly>
